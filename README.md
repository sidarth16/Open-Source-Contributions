## Slither ([crytic-slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither))

- [Enhancement `#2753`](https://github.com/crytic/slither/pull/2753)  
*(feat: Add Function module to detect functions returning msg.sender directly or via alias*)<br/>
This PR introduces a new method `is_returning_msg_sender()` in the Function class, enabling detection of Solidity functions that return `msg.sender`, either directly or through transitive variable aliasing.
    - The newly added method `Function.is_returning_msg_sender()` returns True if:
        - The function directly returns `msg.sender` , 
        - The function returns a variable that was directly or transitively assigned from msg.sender


 - [Fix Bug `#2747`](https://github.com/crytic/slither/pull/2748/)  
 Updates the logic in ```get_msg_sender_checks()```, removing duplicates & repeated ```msg.sender``` condition nodes


 - [Enhancement `#1722`](https://github.com/crytic/slither/pull/1722)  
 Adds function that would be helpful to de-register a detector class from the list of detectors already registered with the slither object

- [Enhancement `#1724`](https://github.com/crytic/slither/pull/1724)  
Adds a function that Un-Register a printer class from the list of printers already registered with the slither object.


- [`#1705`](https://github.com/crytic/slither/pull/1705) , [`#2751`](https://github.com/crytic/slither/pull/2751) ( *Fix typo's* )
    - [`#1705`](https://github.com/crytic/slither/pull/1705) - misspelt ```msg.sender``` in the reentrancy-eth module
    -  [`#2751`](https://github.com/crytic/slither/pull/2751) - misspelt terms in function doc-strings

##  Cairo-Lang Book ([cairo-book](https://github.com/cairo-book/cairo-book))

- [Enhancement `#1201`](https://github.com/cairo-book/cairo-book/pull/1201) : Fix test run inconsistencies and output mismatches in (`ch10_01`)
    - Fixes inconsistencies in test cases sections of `assert!`, `assert_eq!`, `assert_ne!`, `#[should_panic]`, `#[ignore]` Macros and section of : Running Single Tests 
    - Adds missing testcases in the contracts and fixes output logs as expected behaviour

- [Enhancement `#1193`](https://github.com/cairo-book/cairo-book/pull/1193)  
    - Adds note on multiple derivable traits on structs

-  [Enhancement `#1191`](https://github.com/cairo-book/cairo-book/pull/1191) : Tuple Matching Only Supports Enums (`ch06-04`)  
    - Issue: The "Matching Tuples" section implies that all tuple types can be used in match, but tuples with primitive types like (u8, u8) cause a compile-time error.

    - Fix: Add a note/text clarification that tuple matching currently supports only enums.

- [Issue `#1192`](https://github.com/cairo-book/cairo-book/pull/1192)  
Rephrase generics example sentence for clarity

- [Issue `#1190`](https://github.com/cairo-book/cairo-book/pull/1190)  
Fix incorrect usage of function names in quiz.
